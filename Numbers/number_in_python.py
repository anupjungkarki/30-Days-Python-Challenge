# Numbers in python there are following numbers in python
# An integer is a number without decimal point for example 5, 6, 10 etc.

# A float is a number with decimal point for example 6.7, 6.0, 10.99 etc.

# A complex number has a real and imaginary part for example 7+8j, 8+11j etc.

x = 2 + 3j
print(type(x))

y = 20

# Use of type conversion
c = 20
a = float(c)

s = int(w)
print(type(s))
print(s)
